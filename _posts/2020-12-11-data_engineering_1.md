title: What data engineers actually do, part 1
---

Beyond the well-understood problems of no data and dirty/fragmented data, companies without data engineers usually suffer from two things:

Data silos: There's data, and probably a lot of it, but most data sources have no physical connection to each other. In extreme cases large stores of data effectively exist in a contextless vacuum, unavailable to many users who can't easily access them in conjunction with other data sources. As far as these struggling companies are concerned, that data exists in relation to other data and needs to be viewed as part of that larger whole in order to be useful.

Ad hoc data analysis: As a result of the previous problem, data professionals have limited ability to work with others. They can't easily share their insights or applications with each other. They might be forced to build temporary or unscalable data pipelines and workflows for themselves or their teams that no one else in the company can access or contribute to. They might be frustrating themselves building dashboards that no one else ever looks at. They might not even have the ability to get large-scale views of their data because the infrastructure for that doesn't exist yet.
