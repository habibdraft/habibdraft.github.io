title: KDD algebra 2005-2006 intro
---

The current iteration of this model focuses on three of the four main conceptual components of the dataset: problem, knowledge component, and opportunity. Primarily, the complexity of a problem-step is reflected in the number of knowledge components it contains, the temporal component in the opportunity count associated with each knowledge component, and the conceptual category in the problem name and problem hierarchy (portion of the curriculum).

Knowledge component (KC) as defined by [PSLC](https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/KDDCup/rules_data_format.jsp) is “a generalization of everyday terms like concept, principle, fact, or skill, and cognitive science terms like schema, production rule, misconception, or facet.” In an algebra transaction, KCs are represented by string values similar to "combine like terms" or "identify the slope of a line." The author of a problem and potentially additional researchers provide the knowledge components associated with a transaction (also called a problem-step).

A feature that works in conjunction with KC is opportunity (represented in the dataset as Opportunity(Default)). For each knowledge component present in a transaction, the associated opportunity value tells us the number of times the student has already encountered that KC while using the software. As a preliminary way to introduce the opportunity component into this analysis, I have assigned the opportunity value of each KC to a one-hot indicator column representing that KC and summed the opportunity values (so a step with two KCs that had each been encountered 5 times would have an opportunity "sum" of 10). A data sample from a geometry problem set is available [here](https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/KDDCup/rules_data_format.jsp#table-1).

As a result the solution focuses heavily on the number of knowledge components a problem contains, which in part determines the difficulty level of that problem, and the number of opportunities a student has had to solve that problem, which contributes to the skill level the student has reached for that category of problem.
