Knowledge component (KC) as defined by PSLC is “a generalization of everyday terms like concept, principle, fact, or skill, and cognitive science terms like schema, production rule, misconception, or facet.”

One way I can define proficiency at a KC is by observing the number of times a student answers a question containing a particular KC correctly on the first try as a fraction of how many times they encounter questions containing that KC. This is a simplified assessment; first, student performance tends to improve over time, so a more detailed model would take temporal relationships into account; second, students only see remedial problems if they don’t do well on the original problems they are given, so a more detailed model would take these causal relationships into account.
