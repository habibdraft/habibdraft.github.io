Knowledge component (KC) as defined by [PSLC](https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/KDDCup/rules_data_format.jsp) is “a generalization of everyday terms like concept, principle, fact, or skill, and cognitive science terms like schema, production rule, misconception, or facet.”

One way I can define proficiency at a KC is by observing the number of times a student answers a question containing a particular KC correctly on the first try as a fraction of how many times they encounter questions containing that KC. This is a simplified assessment; first, student performance tends to improve over time, so a more detailed model would take temporal relationships into account; second, students only see remedial problems if they don’t do well on the original problems they are given, so a more detailed model would take these causal relationships into account.

The current part of the analysis is a binary classification problem, the goal of which is to predict whether the target Correct First Attempt will take a value of 1 (the student answered the step correctly on the first try and received no hints) or 0 (the student did not answer the step correctly on the first try or received hints) for each row. An off-the-shelf random forests classifier will achieve a baseline AUC/ROC score of about 0.6 using the current cleaned and unpacked feature set.
