### Format

A typical algebra or geometry **problem** involves a number of predetermined steps a student will have to complete before they can arrive at a final answer. The student's completion of each **step** is recorded by the software as a transaction and appears as a single row entry in our data table.

| Student   | Problem  | Step  | Incorrects   | Correct First Attempt  | KC   | Opportunity |
| --------- |--------|-----| ------------- |-------|-----| ------------- |-------------|-----|
| S01 | Solve for one variable | -5+9y = -6 | 2 | 0 | Remove-Constant | 1 |
| S01 | Solve for one variable | 9y = -1 | 1 | 0 | Remove-Coefficient | 5 |
| S01 | Solve for one variable | 4-8 = -6x+8-8 | 0 | 1 | Consolidate-Variables | 2 |
