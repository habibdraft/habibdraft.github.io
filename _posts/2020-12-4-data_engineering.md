title: Career tips for data engineers
---


1. Don't stagnate. As you mature into your role, you'll probably see your favorite tools evolve and get easier to use. Keep moving forward in your role and learning new technologies so you can keep up with the field as it advances.
2. Don't be lazy. Be kind to your future self. Don't put off difficult tasks until they're too big and unwieldy to fix. Anticipate and resolve structural issues before they become real problems, especially when you're working with data that's likely to grow prohibitively large. 
3. Don't try to work alone. Data science is a team sport, and data engineering especially so. A big part of your value-add as a data engineer is doing a lot of unglamorous work to make other people's jobs easier. 
4. Don't get wrapped up in jargon. Very often the job is about the data itself, not just about the work it takes to make the data useful. If you're in an industry where you have subject matter expertise, focus on building that expertise and growing in your role.
5. Don't feel the need to be pigeonholed. As in many tech professions, much of the work of data engineers is becoming easier to abstract away. You are not always going to be asked to set up CI/CD pipelines or deploy container orchestration as more and more companies get through that process themselves or employ third-party products to do it for them. The parts of your job that are hard just because they're annoying and no one has managed to do them yet will start to happen less and less. Many times the setup is a one-time process and the job becomes maintaining the system while it's in use.
