title: Career advice for data engineers
---


1. Don't stagnate. As you mature into your role, you'll probably see your favorite tools evolve and get easier to use. Keep moving forward in your role and learning new technologies so you can keep up with the field as it advances.

2. Don't be lazy. Be kind to your future self. Don't put off difficult tasks until they're too big and unwieldy to fix. Anticipate and resolve structural issues before they become real problems, especially when you're working with data that's likely to grow large enough to become unmanageable. 

3. Be a team player. A big part of your value-add as a data engineer is doing a lot of the unglamorous work that makes other people's jobs easier. Your work will probably have domain-specific and domain-agnostic aspects. Get used to being flexible and responsive. 

4. Use a production-level IDE when you code. Even if you genuinely like coding in jupyter notebooks like I do, they're not good for production and using them will hold you back. You want to be able to collaborate with your team as seamlessly as possible. Use the IDE that the rest of your team uses or find a comparable one with the features you need to work effectively. 

4. Don't get wrapped up in jargon. Very often the job is about the data itself, not just about the work it takes to make the data useful. If you're in an industry where you have subject matter expertise, focus on building that expertise and growing in your role.

5. Don't feel the need to be pigeonholed. As in many tech professions, much of the work of data engineers is becoming easier to abstract away. You are not always going to be asked to set up CI/CD pipelines or deploy container orchestration as more and more companies get through that process themselves or employ third-party products to do it for them. The parts of your job that are hard just because they're annoying and no one has managed to do them yet will start to happen less and less. Many times the setup is a one-time process and the job becomes maintaining the system while it's in use.
